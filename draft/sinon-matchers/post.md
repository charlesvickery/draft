I'm a huge fan of [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) for test spies, stubs, fake timers, etc â€“ but I continually learn new things about it. *This week I learned* about [sinon matchers](http://sinonjs.org/docs/#matchers).

While some of us were pairing on a test case at LeanKit this week, we needed to verify part of an object passed into a method we were stubbing.

Previously, if we had to test something like this, we'd use the `args` on the stub:

```js
var stub = sinon.stub();
stub( "topicName", { other: "field", some: "object" } );

// In the test
stub.lastCall.args[0].should.equal( "topicName" );
stub.lastCall.args[1].some.should.equal( "object" );
```

It is much nicer to write using sinon's `calledWith` method, but this would fail since we are doing a partial match:

```js
// this test fails
stub.should.be.calledWith( "topicName", { some: "object" } );
```

_(We use [chai](http://chaijs.com/) and its `should` syntax with [sinon-chai](https://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai) to achieve this syntax.)_

However, now with sinon matchers, we can write the following and it will match the partial object:

```js
stub.should.be.calledWith( "topicName", sinon.match( { some: "object" } ) );
```

You can use `regexp`, `string` and other matchers as well including a custom function matcher and nested matchers. I can't wait to use these more in our tests going forward.
